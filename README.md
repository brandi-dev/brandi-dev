My name is Brandi and I enjoy the challenge of developing applications, debugging code, and researching programming concepts. I am working through The Web Developer Boot Camp on Udemy in pursuit of this passion and pushing the concepts I learn onto GitHub. I would love to contribute to projects and I am excited for what the future may hold. In addition to building up these skills, I am currently attending the University of Massachusetts Lowell in pursuit of a second bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology with an emphasis on object-oriented programming.
